An oil refinery produces **two types** of unleaded gasoline:

- **regular**: which sells to distributors at the price of $12 per barrel;

- **extra**: which sells to distributors at the price of $14 per barrel.

Both types are made from a **national** refined oil and an **imported** refined oil stock, that the company owns (i.e. by blending them):

| Oil | Steam Pressure | Octane Rating | Inventory (Barrel) |
| :---:         |     :---:      |  :---: | :---:      |
| National   | 25     | 87   |    40,000        |             
| Imported     | 15       | 98      | 60,000    |             

Both types must also comply with the specifications contained in the following table:

| Oil | Maximum Steam Pressure | Minimum Octane Rating | Maximum Demand (barrel/week) | Minimum Delivery (Barrel/Week) |
| :---:         |     :---:      |  :---: | :---:      |     :---:     |
| National   | 23     | 88   |    100,000        |  50,000   |        
| Imported     | 23       | 93      | 20,000    |   5,000    |  

**Goal** : The refinery aims at determining the number of barrels of each gasoline type such that 

- it can maximize the weekly income

- while satisfying the requirements detailed above.

**Task**: Model this problem into an LP problem and solve it.
