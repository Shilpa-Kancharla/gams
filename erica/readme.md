Young MBA Erica Cudahy may invest up to $1000. She can invest her money in stocks and loans. Each dollar invested in stocks 
yields 10 cents of profit, and each dollar invested in a loan yields 15 cents of profit. At least 30% of all money invested 
must be in stocks, and at least $400 must be in loans. Formulate an LP to maximize total profit earned from Ericaâ€™s investment.
